FeatGraph: Sparse kernels for GNNs based on TVM
===============================================

We have moved latest repo to amazon research:
- https://github.com/amazon-research/FeatGraph

This repo will not longer be maintained.

The [lnzhi-dev](https://github.com/dglai/FeatGraph/tree/lnzhi-dev) branch includes some
experimental code as extension work to featgraph (e.g. generalized SpMM and generalized
SDDMM w/ broadcasting), credits to [Zhi Lin](https://github.com/kira-lin).

[This PR](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/pull/2136) describes how to integrate featgraph
in DGL.
